UAP Intel
In this section, you will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Don’t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience.

For example; Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club.

Most UAP entusiasts are lookign for evidence in the form of videos or photographs, hence the first link made available to teh user is the evidence page where the most recently released or declassified UAP videos can be found, allowing the user to dive right in.

Insiders page is offered up next, providing the user with some of teh most compelling sources of imformation on UAP. The purpose of this page is to introduce the user to icons of teh UAP subject, pointign the user in the right direction to find information from credible sources.

Theories

This page contains an article that attempst to lay out the main theories that try to explain where UAPs might come from, why they are here and what they want.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
 

Features Left to Implement
In hte future I woul like to add a comment section that invites users to post there own experinces sightings or encounters with UAP and post any images of videos they may have as well as catlogue locations which would populate a world wide map to users can see exactly where sightings occur.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

The image links on teh landing page increase in sise and drecrease in brightness and text highlights in yellow to clearly indicate that the link is functional and invites interaction. The images are used to draw the users attention. And the text under each image gives a brief description of what content awaits. The links are of sufficient size to be user freindly and not "fiddly". The navigation bar is sutble but clearly visible and provides a traditional form of navigation.

The Evidence page is simple in appears to work well. the user simply scrolls down to access video content. Likewise the Insiders page is simple in appearance with content arranged vertically, very easy to navigate and providing users with bite sized snioppets of information.

The theroioes page provides an article that quickly introduices the user to theories that try to answer the most basic questions regarding UAPs. The user gets quick access to conscice information.

The sign up page changes the colour pallet to provide a little variety and off users an opportunity to sign up for a news letter.

All links tested and confirmed working. Chrome develpoer tools was used to ensure the sites pages looked good on various screen sizes all teh way down to 320px wide. Numerous adjustments were made and checked repeatedly. On full size screens the landing pages content assumes and landscape orientation spread from left to right acoss the page. As the screen size gets smaller, teh page elements begin to assume a sqaure or verical layout so that all teh content can fit on screen and finally on smart phone screen sizes, the content becomes even more vertically oreinted with little or no side margins and the navigation menu becomes simpliflied.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.


If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Credits
In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

Content

I used code from this youtube video >"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YffrCViTVk*/. The credit for htis video goes to tipswithpunch. The code allowed me to make teh embedded youtube videos I used responsive.

The background images I used come from pixabay. The landign pages image is from here >[insert link]
teh form page image is from here [insert link]

Below is a list of images I used and where to find them:

Bob Lazar image which can be found here
Luis Elizondo image which can be found here
David Fravor image which can be found here
Travis Walton ikage which can be found here

Research on the above individuals was done on wikipedia.com and the historychannel.com, youtube videos too.

The social media links are from Fontawesome.

The content from the "Theroies" page come from a variety of sources over the years, youtube mostly.


The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from Specific YouTube Tutorial
The icons in the footer were taken from Font Awesome
Media
The photos used on the home and sign up page are from This Open Source site
The images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site
Congratulations on completing your Readme, you have made another big stride in the direction of being a developer!

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! Use a colour pallet to hhelp decide which colours to use. Coolor is a fantastic site that can present colour pallets from a photogrpah that you upload. I found this to be an amazing tool as I was having difficulty in chosign colors that work well together. 

Allowing suffientc t=ime for your project is eesential as it is very easy to over estimate how much work you will complete in a any gievn time frame as bugs or other unexpected circuumstances can delay you leading to an insane amount of "crunch" towards the end as your deadline approaceh.

Scope your project cuatiously also , as again its easy top ovrestimate how much work can be compoeted in a given timeframe.

Keep your codign tidy from teh beginign an dsas you go alonm gas iot will make readign and navigating your cown code much easier and save havngit to tidy the code at the. Chose id and class names carefuilly as I pften found mysefl changign teh m later to be a better description adn tis meant having to check carefully that all rules targingt eh ids and classes were also changed accordignly. Lesson learned is to chose the name carefully from teh outsse t , so you dont have to chnage it again.

Remain calm. When you get stuck and some code is not working as you expect, stay calm as getting frustrated makes it harder to find teh fix. If you get really stuck, take a break clear your head, and sometimes the solution will just piop into your head or even pop into you head after sleeping on it. If all else fails, gogle is your firend, but again, searching for answerrs is much harder when angry or frustrated, take you time and stay calm.

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
