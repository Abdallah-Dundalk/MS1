                <h2>Theories</h2>
                <p>Here we take a look at theories that have been put forward by physicists, alien abductees, and subject matter experts. Many theories have been put forward over the years, the most popular idea being that UAPs come from outer space and are piloted by Aliens, but here we will cover everything.

            <h2>What Are They?</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>Flying Saucers</h3>
        <p>Recently, several photographs and videos have been released which show spherical, cube, pyramid and cylindrical or tic-tac shaped craft in the skies with no wings or visible means of propulsion. These craft are often reflective in appearances usually white or metallic in colour though their colour can vary greatly. In 1997 a huge black triangular shaped craft hovered over Arizona. UAPs captured in infra-red recordings have shown heat signatures but no signs of exhaust. Bob Lazar described a UAP that was stored in Area 51 as being saucer shaped.</p>
                
        <h3>Orbs</h3>
        <p>UAPs are also often described as glowing orbs of different colours. World War 2 fighter pilots reported being followed by what they called foo fighters, which translates to balls of fire. Records from Roman soldiers from 2000 years ago mention "shields of fire" following them on above the battlefield. It begs the question of whether foo fighters and shields of fire are different descriptions of the same phenomenon.</p>
                
        <hgroup>
            <h2>Where do they come from?</h2>
            <h3>Aliens from Outer Space</h3>
        </hgroup>   
        <p>By far the most popular theory is that UAPs come from outer space and are piloted by aliens. Bob Lazar has stated that the US army found alien craft and that this he believed was an archaeological find and therefore the craft were of ancient origin. Lazar also said that he was shown documents that stated the beings that piloted the craft came from Zeta Reticuli. 

            When asked if UAPs were of alien origin, Luis Elizondo stated, "I have seen evidence that strongly suggests that we are not alone". Although a little vague in his response, and seemingly hesitant to discuss classified information, this is as good as confirmation that the Pentagon has information suggesting UAPs are of extra-terrestrial origin.</p>
                
        <h3>Time Travelling humans</h3>
        <p>Michael Masters, a professor of biological anthropology at Montana Technological University in Butte. He argues that since we know that we exist and technology continues to advance rapidly, that its conceivable to we will eventually figure out how to travel back in time. He believes that these time travellers would travel back in time for tourism or anthropology etc. 
            It could be argued that the discovery of time travel is…only a matter of time…so long as humans do not become extinct. Many scientists firmly believe that we life only exists on earth, so this theory answers the question of where UPAs come from without relying on the popular alien theory.</p>
                
        <h3>Secret Military Aircraft</h3>
        <p>TThroughout the years, many secret Military projects and experimental aircraft have been spotted by members of the public and mistaken for UAPs. In fact, the US government would probably prefer people to report seeing a UAP than out a secret flight test of an experimental aircraft. 

            The stealth fighter, U2 spy plane and the Blackbird were all developed, and test flown at Area 51. Apparently, a lot of UAP sightings were of these experimental craft. And given there unusual and advanced looking shape, it’s not hard to imagine mistaking these craft for a UPA.</p>
                
        <hgroup>
            <h2>What Do They Want?</h2>
            <h3>Should We Be Concerned</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>Intervention, curiosity or something more sinister? Perhaps the most pertinent question of them all. What exactly do they want? Looking at the different accounts spanning thousands of years, it would appear that UAPs have been around for a long time and yet, we as a species, don’t seem to have suffered because of it. So maybe we don’t need to fear the presence of UAPs. So, is there something special about Earth or is it merely the case that Earth is more of an intergalactic rest stop to refuel before heading off to another destination? 

            We do have evidence from several encounters that show UAPs have disabled nuclear launch silos on more than one occasion and have telepathically communicated with school children with a message warning us to change our ways, so if this is anything to go by, their intentions seem to one of good. However, there are also many accounts of people being injured and receiving burns from close encounters with UAPs, though these injuries could be unintentional. With technology so advanced, there’s no doubt that if they wanted to harm us, we wouldn’t escape with mere burns. 
            
            So, in conclusion, it would appear that, at best, they are here to steer us away from self-annihilation with nuclear weapons, at worst, we are being studied much like how we catch and release wildlife after tagging. Though until contact is made, the mystery of what they want will remain. </p>
