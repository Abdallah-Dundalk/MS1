                <h2>Theories</h2>
                <p>Here we take a look at theories that have been put forward by phyisicts, alien abductees, and subject matter experts. Many theories have been put forward over the years, the most popular idea beign that UAPs coem from outer space and are piloted by Aliens, but here we will cover everything from time travelling humans, to interdimensioanl beings.

            <h2>What Are They?</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>Flying Saucers</h3>
        <p>Recenty, several photgraphs and videos have been released which show spherical, cube, pyramid and cycndrical or tic-tac shaped craft in the skys with no wings or visible means of propulsion. These craft are often reflectivive in appears usually white or metalic in colour though the colour can vary greatly. In 1997 a huge black trianlgual shape craft hovered over Arizona. UAPs captured in infra red recordigns have shown a heat signatures but no signs of exhaust. Bob Lazar descibed a UAP that was stored in Area 51 as beign suacer shaped.</p>
                
        <h3>Orbs</h3>
        <p>Another common description of UAPs is of glowing orbs of different colours. World War 2 fighter pilots reported beign followed by foo fighters which translates to balls of fire. Records from Roman soldiers from 2000 years ago mention "shields of fire" follwoing them on above the battle field.</p>
                
        <hgroup>
            <h2>Where do they come from?</h2>
            <h3>Aliens from Outer Space</h3>
        </hgroup>   
        <p>By far teh most popular theory os that UAPs come from outer space adn are piloted by aliens. Bob Lazar has stated that the US army found ailen craft that were an archeological find and therefore of anchient origin and also said that they came from zeta reticulai. Luis Eliszondo has stated when asked if UAPs were of alien origin, "I have seen evidence that strongly suggests that we are not alone".</p>
                
        <h3>Time Travelling humans</h3>
        <p>[insert name] believes that UAPs could be piloted by time travelling humans given that these craft are beleived to be use antigravity as their method of propulsion (accordign to Bob Lazar). Antigravity makes travelling backwards in time possible.  Humans may ben able to figure out time travel, and since time is endless, it could be argued that the discovery of time travel is a certainty, so long as humans do not become extinct. Many scientists firmly believe that we life only exists on earth, so this theory ansers the question of were UPAs come from without relying on the popular alien theory.</p>
                
        <h3>Secret Military Aircraft</h3>
        <p>Throughout the years, many secret Military projects and experimantal aircraft have been spotted by members of the public and mistaken for UAPs. In fact, the US government would prefer people to report seeign a UAP than out a secret flight test. The US amry released a report in [insert year] stating the wreckage found in rosewell were the remains of an air balloon that was being secretly developed by the airforce. But we some muchg disinformation, it makes it very idfficult to seperate truth from lies.</p>
                
        <h3>Inter-dimensional Beings</h3>
        <p>Placeholder text - theories go here</p>

        <hgroup>
            <h2>What Do They Want?</h2>
            <h3>Should We Be Concerned</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>Intervention, curisoisty or somethign more sinister? Perhaps teh most pertinent question of them all. What exactly do they want? Lookign at the different accounts spanning thousands of years, it would appear that UAPs have been around for a long time and yet, we as a species, dont seem to have suffered because of it. So maybe we dont need to fear the presence of UAPs. So is there somethign speacial about Earth or is it mearly the case that we are more of an intergalactic rest stop to refuel before headign of to there final destination? We do have evidence from several encounters that show UAPs have disabled nuclear lauch silos on more than one accasion and have reported telepathocally communicated with school children arnign us to change our ways, so if this is anythign to go by, their intentions seem to one of good. However, there arte many accounts of people being injured and reicing burns from close eneounters with UAPs , though this is most likely unitintetioanl. With technology so advance, theres no doubt that if they wanted to harm us, we wouldnt escape with mere burns. So in conclusion, it would appear that, at best, they are here to steer us away from self annihilation with nuclear weapons.at worst, we are benign studied much like how we catch and release wild life after tagging. </p>
